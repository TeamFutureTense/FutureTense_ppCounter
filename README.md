# FutureTense In-Game PP Counter Overlay

This component is an in-game overlay powered by [tosu](https://github.com/tosuapp/tosu). This component supports the following features:

- Real-time PP display
- Real-time ranking display

This overlay supports both Stable and Lazer, and work with any skins.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1. Download the latest version from Release

2. Unzip and move the contents within the zip file under `static` folder where you put your `tosu.exe`

3. Open dashboard and make sure your in-game overlay is opened.

4. Open your osu! client and press `Ctrl + Shift + Space` to place your overlay on the screen.

## There are some problems with the component! ðŸ˜¯

- **If you are sure this is a component-related problem** (E.g. styling or not displaying properly), please open up an issue and describe your problem with details. Also, please attach screenshots so that I will know what is exactly going on.

- **Otherwise**, please make sure this is not a problem of tosu! Currently the new in-game overlay and lazer support of tosu is still in beta and might not work properly on your machine. You may open up an issue here but probably I cannot help a lot with that.
